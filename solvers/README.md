# Solvers

This directory contains the source code of Grater and adapted CoverMe.

## Running Grater

The source code of Grater is in `grater`. The way to run it has been introduced [here](https://github.com/grater-exp/grater-experiment?tab=readme-ov-file#running-grater).

## Running CoverMe

CoverMe is not originally designed for floating-point constraints solving, so we adapt it to function as a floating-point constraint solver. The source code of adapted CoverMe is in `coverme`. The way to run it is the same as [XSat](https://github.com/zhoulaifu/xsat).

## Building other solvers

We build other baseline solvers using their release version as introduced [here](https://github.com/grater-exp/grater-experiment?tab=readme-ov-file#baselines). The methods to build and run them are all in their homepages:

[XSat](https://github.com/zhoulaifu/xsat)

[JFS](https://github.com/mc-imperial/jfs)

[Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)

[CVC5](https://github.com/cvc5/cvc5)
