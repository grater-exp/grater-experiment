# Scripts

This directory contains the scripts we used to run experiments. The two csv files `jfs-benchmark.csv` and `our-benchmark.csv` provide the file paths and other information (such as variable number or file size) of benchmarks to guide the baseline solvers solving benchmarks in order. The scripts can be run directly, like:

```
./bitwuzla.sh
```

after bitwuzla has been installed successfully. Other solvers are the same.
